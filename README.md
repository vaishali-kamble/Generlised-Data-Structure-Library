# Generlised-Data-Structure-Library

Tools: C++, Visual Studio Code

• This application is a library which contains generic implementations of all major type of data structure.
• We provide readymade implementations of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operations on linear, nonlinear data structures in object-oriented way.
• We provide the generic way of implementation so we can use the functionality for any data type.
• All the object-oriented design policies are used.
